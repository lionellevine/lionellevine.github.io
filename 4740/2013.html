<p>For many years this course was taught by longtime Cornellian <a href="http://www.math.duke.edu/~rtd/">Rick Durrett</a> (now at Duke Univeristy) who also wrote our textbook. This year's course is modeled on the one taught last year by <a 
href="http://www.math.cornell.edu/~neldredge">Nate Eldredge</a>.

<h3>Textbook</h3>

<p><i>Essentials of Stochastic Processes</i>, by Durrett.</p>

<p>The first edition, made out of dead trees, is available at the Cornell store, and a copy is on reserve at the Mathematics Library (4th floor Malott Hall).</p> 

<p>Here is a list of <a href="2013/durrett-errata.pdf">known typos in the first edition</a>.</p>

<p>And here is the <a href="http://www.math.duke.edu/~rtd/EOSP/EOSP2E.pdf">second edition</a>, made out of electrons. 

We are compiling a <a href="http://4740.wikidot.com">list of typos in the 2nd edition.</a></p>

<h3>Other sources</h3>

<p>If Durrett crimps your style, take a look at these books which cover roughly the same material:</p>

<ul> 
<li><i>Introduction to Stochastic Modeling</i>, by Taylor and Karlin</li>
<li><i>Introduction to Probability Models</i>, by Ross</li>
</ul>

<p>For the extra topics, we may dip into a couple more advanced books:

<ul>
<li><i><a href="http://pages.uoregon.edu/dlevin/MARKOV/markovmixing.pdf">Markov Chains and Mixing Times</a></i>, by Levin, Peres and Wilmer</li>
<li><i><a href="http://mypage.iu.edu/~rdlyons/prbtree/prbtree.html">Probability on Trees and Networks</a></i>, by Lyons (with Peres)</li>
</ul>

<!--<p>Various other common textbooks are also on reserve.  The list of reserve books can be seen <a href="http://www.library.cornell.edu/course_help/search/MATH%204740">here</a> (if the library has fixed it correctly).</p>-->

<!-- <p>Approximately weekly. Usually you will get the problem set on Friday and it is due at the beginning of class the following Friday.</p> -->

<p>Please check out the <a href="2013/guidelines.html">problem set guidelines</a> for how to write a good solution.</p>

<p>You are strongly encouraged to type your problem sets using <a href="http://www.latex-project.org/">LaTeX</a> (or LyX). LaTeX is very versatile and widely used for writing technical documents of all kinds. It will serve you well if you go on in
math or another technical field. Besides, you will need it for your <a href="2013/project.html">project</a>! <em>Neatly</em> handwritten problem sets are also acceptable.</p>

<p><b><font color="red">New</font></b>: Here is a <a href="/4740/2013/4740-pset-6-solutions.tex">sample LaTeX file</a> and the <a href="/4740/2013/4740-pset-6-solutions.pdf">pdf output it generates</a>. </p>

<p>Here is a <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W_yPJsF1X18&list=SPDD406480D35CE390">video tutorial</a> to get you started with LaTeX. Another good resource is the <a href="http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/LaTeX">LaTeX wikibook</a>.  The <a 
href="http://www.math.cornell.edu/twiki/bin/view/MSC">Cornell math support center</a> can help you get LaTeX up and running. (Ask for a math major tutor!)</p>

<p>Two times during the semester, you may have an automatic 72-hour extension on a problem set. This does not require prior approval, just hand it in at the beginning of the next class with a note saying you are using an extension. Otherwise, late homework will 
not be accepted except in an emergency (in which case you must inform me as soon as possible).</p>

<a name="groupwork"></a>
<p><b>Group work policy:</b> Working together with other students to solve the problems is encouraged. However, you must understand the solution yourself and write it up entirely in your own words. Discussing your solution with others is fine, but do not share 
your written 
solution with another student. If you work in a group, list the group members at the top of your problem
set.</p>

<h3>Exams</h3>
<p>One in-class prelim on <b>Friday, March 1</b>.  Final exam on <b>Thursday, May 16</b>.  The exams are closed book.</p>
<p>If a conflict prevents you from completing the exams on these dates, please let me know immediately.</p>

<p><a href="/4740/2013/4740-prelim-practice.pdf">Practice problems</a> for the prelim.</p>

<p><a href="/4740/2013/4740-prelim-solutions.pdf">Solutions</a> to the prelim. The mean was 42 out of 60 and the standard deviation was 9. Approximate grade ranges: A (47-57), B (31-46), C (22-30).</p>


<h3>Course Project</h3>
<p>The course project allows you to explore a topic of your choice in depth. You will choose a peer-reviewed journal article that uses stochastic processes to model some real world phenomenon, and write a critical summary of the article analyzing the 
strengths and weaknesses of the model it proposes.</p>

<p>Check out the <a href="2013/project.html">project guidelines</a> for details.</p>

<ul>
<li>First draft due by the beginning of class on <b>Friday, April 12</b>. </li>
<li>Final version due by the beginning of class on <b>Friday, April 26</b>.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Grading</h3>
<ul>
<li>Problem Sets: 40%. All problem sets count equally, none are dropped.</li>
<li>Prelim: 15%</li>
<li>Course Project: 15%</li>
<li>Final: 30%.  The final exam is cumulative.</li>
</ul>
<p><u><i>Graduate students</i></u>: If you are taking the course for credit, you will need to complete all the regular coursework (homework, exams and project), and will be assigned a grade like any other student.  If you are taking the course S/U, you still 
need to do the coursework; I will compute a letter grade as usual and then assign you an S if the letter grade is at least C-.  If you are not interested in doing the coursework, you are welcome to audit the course instead.</p>

<h3>Laptop-free zone</h3>
Recent experiments show that even though people feel like they are accomplishing more when they multitask, they actually accomplish less.  Higher level mathematics really demands your full attention. 
It's hard enough to learn stochastic processes without the temptation of facebook and <a 
href="http://xkcd.com">xkcd</a> (yes, the lure of xkcd is strong. very strong.)
So please keep laptops, ipads, phones and other gizmos in your bag during class.  If you really must use a device during class (for example, to take notes on your tablet or laptop), you may do so in the back row where it does not distract anyone.

<h3>Students with disabilities</h3>
<p>The Cornell disability policy is as follows.  If you have a disability‐related need for reasonable academic adjustments in this course, provide me with an accommodation letter from <a href="http://sds.cornell.edu/">Student Disability Services</a>.  Students are 
expected to give two weeks notice of the need for accommodations.  If you need immediate accommodations, please arrange to meet with me within the first two class meetings.</p>

<h3>Academic integrity</h3>
<p>Please read carefully the <a href="2013.html#groupwork">group work policy</a> for problem sets. I, your classmates, and the entire Cornell community expect you to complete this course based on your own work, to abide by relevant rules for coursework and exams, and to 
clearly 
attribute any use 
of the work of others. The <a 
href="http://cuinfo.cornell.edu/Academic/AIC.html">Cornell Academic Integrity Policy</a> spells out the nasty details of what happens otherwise.</p>
